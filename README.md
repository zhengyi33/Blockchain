# Blockchain

Multiple processes compete to verify a block and the verified block is concatenated to the ledger shared by all processes. 

The verifying procedure, namely, the “work”, is a puzzle with easily modifiable level of difficulty. 

Public key encryption is used in the signing and verification of the blocks. 

XML is used as external data format for the communication between processes and the storing of the ledger.
